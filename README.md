# VicFirth-Product-Page
This project uses HTML and CSS to create a product page for Vic Firth drumsticks.  

I used the @media CSS property to change the styling of the nav bar and product prices to vertical.  

This project is based off FreeCodeCamp's third project challenge and was built from scratch by myself.
